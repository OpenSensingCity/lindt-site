# Linked Datatypes 

The Linked Datatypes initative aims at enabling lightweight descriptions of 
useful knowledge on the Web of Data, using simple RDF literals empowered by RDF Datatypes.

The flagship Datatype is [http://w3id.org/lindt/custom_datatypes#ucum](cdt:ucum) that
can be used to describe measurements with any unit defined in [http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html](The Unified Code for Units of Measure)
